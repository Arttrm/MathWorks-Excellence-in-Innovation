<p>Reduce the cost of 5G and IoT network deployment by generating coverage maps from limited measurements.</p>
</table>

## Motivation

New 5G and IoT systems are driving the deployment of dense small cell networks and leading the way to the smart cities of tomorrow.
Companies need to use signal coverage maps to optimize and validate their networks but collecting signal measurements to generate those maps is an expensive process.
To reduce cost there is a need to apply prediction models to generate coverage maps from limited, sparse measurement data.

## Projects Description

Use MATLAB® and toolboxes to implement, explore, and compare different techniques for predicting signal coverage from real signal measurements. Develop propagation models from the measurements data and use them to generate coverage maps for new scenarios.

Suggested steps:

1.	Locate signal measurement datasets such as those provided by mobile data analytics companies
2.	Research data-driven techniques using machine learning for defining propagation models from measurements
3.	Design and implement propagation models in MATLAB using the measurements data 
4.	Generate coverage maps using your propagation models and compare your results against theoretical propagation models
